Today, we will learn about Actions on Google. To use Action on Google, we need to sign into the [actions on google console](https://console.actions.google.com/)
To continue, sign into your console.

### Types of actions.
There are various kinds of actions, some are intent based, some are context based, or fallback-based.
let's go through them.

So today, we will develop a chatbot using Dialogflow and Actions on Google.
let's talk go chatbot!

### What is a chatbot?

At the most basic level, a chatbot is a computer program that simulates and processes human conversation (either written or spoken), allowing humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communicating with a real person. Chatbots can be as simple as rudimentary programs that answer a simple query with a single-line response, or as sophisticated as digital assistants that learn and evolve to deliver increasing levels of personalization as they gather and process information. 

### What is DialogFlow, and how does it help?

Dialogflow is an end-to-end, build-once deploy-everywhere development suite for creating conversational interfaces for websites, mobile applications, popular messaging platforms, and IoT devices. You can use it to build interfaces (such as chatbots and conversational IVR) that enable natural and rich interactions between your users and your business. Dialogflow Enterprise Edition users have access to Google Cloud Support and a service level agreement (SLA) for production deployments.
